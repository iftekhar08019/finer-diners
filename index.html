            <p class="para-style">The Finer Diner is a popular stop all year long. This quaint eatery is a welcoming licensed restaurant featuring classic diner fare, Nova Scotian favorites, and playful daily specials. You will find interesting Fine Art painting and sculpture in an old fashioned setting with incredible views of the historic fishing inlet called Boutilier’s Cove. Guests can enjoy a sunset meal on our covered patio, or a slice of our homemade pie in a cozy booth. The diner is a renovated general store and has been the heartbeat of Hackett’s Cove for over 100 years. We look forward to serving you. </p>

        <h2>Our Recipies</h2>
        <p>These days it may seem odd to speak of "grandma's cookie receipt," but at one time the only meaning of receipt was "recipe." The first recorded use of receipt is a reference to a medicinal preparation in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (c. 1386). Recipe didn't arrive until the 1500s, and it was also first used to describe medicine. Both words began to be applied to cooking only in the 18th century, after which recipe slowly became the preferred word.</p>
