            <p class="para-style">The Finer Diner is a popular stop all year long. This quaint eatery is a welcoming licensed restaurant featuring classic diner fare, Nova Scotian favorites, and playful daily specials. You will find interesting Fine Art painting and sculpture in an old fashioned setting with incredible views of the historic fishing inlet called Boutilier’s Cove. Guests can enjoy a sunset meal on our covered patio, or a slice of our homemade pie in a cozy booth. The diner is a renovated general store and has been the heartbeat of Hackett’s Cove for over 100 years. We look forward to serving you. </p>
