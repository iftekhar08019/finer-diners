        <h2>Our Recipies</h2>
        <p>These days it may seem odd to speak of "grandma's cookie receipt," but at one time the only meaning of receipt was "recipe." The first recorded use of receipt is a reference to a medicinal preparation in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (c. 1386). Recipe didn't arrive until the 1500s, and it was also first used to describe medicine. Both words began to be applied to cooking only in the 18th century, after which recipe slowly became the preferred word.</p>

            <h2>Chicken Pasta</h2>

            <h2>Japanese Mum's Chicken</h2>
            <p>Place all the ingredients in a saucepan over a high heat. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for about 20 minutes. Remove any scum that rises to the surface. Increase the heat, turning the drumsticks frequently in the liquid, and cook until the liquid has reduced to a sticky glaze. Arrange the chicken on a serving platter, remove the garlic clove and chili from the liquid, and spoon the glaze over.</p>

            <h2>Carrot Cake</h2>
            <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and cinnamon; make a well in the center and add sugar, oil, eggs and vanilla. Mix with wooden spoon until smooth. Stir in carrots, coconut, walnuts and pineapple. Pour into 9x13 inch pan and bake for about 45 minutes. Don't panic, the centre will sink a little.</p>
